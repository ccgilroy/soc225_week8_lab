# Google Trends

## Single term

Go to Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) and search for "crisis actors." Look at variation by time and by region. 

**Question: why is there a spike in mid-February?** Look at the related topics and queries for hints at the answer.

## Comparison

Compare the relative popularity of the following social media platforms using Google Trends: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. **According to Google Trends, what is the order of popularity for these platforms? Do you think volume of Google searches is a good metric of social media use?**

## Try it out

Come up with a set of search terms that you think would make an interesting comparison, and describe your results here.

## Embedding a Google Trends widget

You can embed a Google Trends widget as an interactive object, but the steps are a little tricky: 

1. In Google Trends, click the "Embed" button ("< >") and copy the code
2. Paste it into your Rmd file, and knit to html
3. Open the html in Chrome
4. Inspect the chart, and copy the "iframe" element
5. Paste *that* into your Rmd file, and delete the original script
6. Add a height to the iframe (e.g. height="450px")
7. Regenerate and reopen the html

The final result should look like this: 

<iframe id="trends-widget-1" src="https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/explore/TIMESERIES?req=%7B%22comparisonItem%22%3A%5B%7B%22keyword%22%3A%22crisis%20actors%22%2C%22geo%22%3A%22US%22%2C%22time%22%3A%22today%2012-m%22%7D%5D%2C%22category%22%3A0%2C%22property%22%3A%22%22%7D&amp;tz=420&amp;eq=q%3Dcrisis%2520actors%26geo%3DUS%26date%3Dtoday%2012-m" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" height="450px"></iframe>

**Below, embed one of the charts from your Google Trends search in the previous question.**

# Google Ngrams

The Google Ngram Viewer draws on Google Books to show the use of terms over time. It has some interesting uses, especially in digital humanities, but with important caveats: https://www.wired.com/2015/10/pitfalls-of-studying-language-with-google-ngram/

(What's a n-gram? A sequence of one or more words.)

Try looking at references to different communications technologies, e.g., the Internet, TV, and radio. Do the results change if you make the searches case-insensitive?

# Challenge: Google Takeout

Download some of your own data from Google Takeout: https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout

I recommend only picking one or two applications! Otherwise, your download file will be very large. Read this Twitter thread for some examples: https://twitter.com/iamdylancurran/status/977559925680467968

Look at your Google data, and describe the data structure. See if you can read some of the files into R.
